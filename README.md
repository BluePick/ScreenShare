# ScreenShare
ScreenShare is a great demo tool that allows you to mirror your iOS devices to your screen.

### This is great for:
  - Creating extremely clean demos.
  - When you have a demo and want it to look amazing!
  - When you don't have a Wi-Fi network available, or your customer won't let you on theirs.
  - Doing a demo of your app's offline capabilities
  - Live demos in front of thousands of people.
